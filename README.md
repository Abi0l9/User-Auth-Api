# User Authentication Api

This is the first project out of 10 APIs I would like to build to showcase my knowledge of REST and GraphQL using MERN Stack.

This API has the following endpoints:

```
	- http://localhost:3001/api
	- http://localhost:3001/api/users
	- http://localhost:3001/api/users/actions
	- http://localhost:3001/api/login
	- http://localhost:3001/api/logout
```

More documentations to follow...
